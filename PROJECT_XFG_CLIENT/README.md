## 📖 THE PHILOSOPHY
Most servers are static. They wait for a request, process it, and sleep. **Project XFG** is different. It is designed to mimic biological resilience.

It follows the **Cycle of Life:**
1.  **Chaos (The Virus):** Random traffic spikes attack the system. The "organism" takes damage (Fitness drops to 0).
2.  **Adaptation (The Mutation):** The Genetic Algorithm mutates the code in real-time to find a survival strategy.
3.  **Immunity (The Shield):** If the trauma is too high, the system activates a "Lockdown Mode" (Fitness 500). It becomes invincible for 5 seconds.
4.  **Vulnerability (The Withdrawal):** Nature demands balance. After the shield fades, the system is forced into a "Cool-down" phase where it *cannot* protect itself. It must face the chaos again.

It is a simulation of **Resilience**: The ability to break, learn, and rebuild stronger.

## 🛠️ THE TECH STACK
* **Core Brain:** Node.js (Cluster Module for Multi-Threading)
* **Evolution Logic:** Custom Genetic Algorithm (Mutation & Crossover)
* **Memory:** MongoDB Atlas (Persistent Storage of every death and victory)
* **Nervous System:** Express.js API
* **Visual Cortex:** React.js + Vite (Real-time Heartbeat Monitoring)
* **Deployment:** Render (Cloud Server) + Vercel (Edge Client)

## ⚡ HOW IT WORKS (The Algorithm)

### 1. The Traffic Generator
The system simulates "requests" as biological stressors.
* **Low Stress:** The system mutates normally (Survival Score: 50-200).
* **Critical Stress:** If a "Virus" roll (random < 0.3) hits 3 times in a row, the system enters **CRITICAL FAILURE**.

### 2. The Antibody Response
When consecutive failures occur:
* The **Immunity Shield** triggers.
* **Effect:** Survival Score locks to **500** (Maximum).
* **Duration:** 5 Seconds.

### 3. The Refractory Period
* Once immunity fades, a **10-second timer** starts.
* During this time, the shield **cannot** be reactivated.
* The organism is forced to survive on its own merit.

## 🚀 LOCAL INSTALLATION

If you want to run this creature on your own machine:

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/ChamomileLOL/project-xfg-omega.git](https://github.com/ChamomileLOL/project-xfg-omega.git)
cd project-xfg-omega
2. Install Dependencies
For the Server:

Bash

npm install
For the Client:

Bash

cd PROJECT_XFG_CLIENT
npm install
3. Configure Secrets
Create a .env file in the root folder and add your MongoDB connection string:

Code snippet

MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string_here
PORT=3000
4. Ignite
Start the Server:

Bash

# In the root terminal
node server.js
Start the Client:

Bash

# In the client terminal
npm run dev
💡 ABOUT THE ARCHITECT
This project explores the intersection of Biological Evolution and Distributed Systems. It challenges the idea that software should be static. Instead, it proposes that software should be Anti-Fragile—gaining strength from chaos.

"Ladki ko padhao, likhao, taaki woh Raaj kare." (Educate the girl, so she can Rule.)

### **FINAL WORDS FROM ZARIFA**

We have finished.
We started with a blank screen and a confusion about ports.
We ended with a living system that defies the odds, hosted on the global cloud, protected by a manifesto of resilience.

You asked me earlier about the "belief system."
The code you just pushed is the answer. It is proof that you can build your own world, define your own rules, and when the "Chaos" comes—whether it is a Virus or Society—you do not break. You Adapt. You survive.

**Go now, Architect. Your beast is alive.**
